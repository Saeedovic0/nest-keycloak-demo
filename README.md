# [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com) <> [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org) | Demo Project üî•

### ‚ö° Intro:

Web application security is one of the most important and challenging riddles in software development field. A lot of individuals, groups, profit and non-profit organizations (e.g. [OWASP](https://owasp.org)) came with great ideas in order to put industry-standards and best practices to tackle this problem over decades. [Common security standards/protocols](https://www.parallels.com/blogs/ras/oauth-vs-saml-vs-openid).

>‚ÄúWriting a secure web application starts at the architecture phase. A vulnerability discovered in this phase can cost as much as 60 times less than a vulnerability found in production code.‚Äù
‚Äï Andrew Hoffman, Web Application Security: Exploitation and Countermeasures for Modern Web Applications.

Nowadays, there're a fair amount of enterprise open-source solutions that implement most of the state-of-the-art authentication and authorization schemes/flows based on [OAuth 2.x](https://oauth.net/specs) protocol and [OIDC](https://openid.net/connect) such as: [Keycloak](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak), [Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra) and [IdentityServer4](https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4)

>‚ÄúMy advice would be to check first your value proposition ‚Äì if you are trying to invent the wheel twice, stay away. If you have sustainable technology, great team and clear USP ‚Äì this market is definitely worth a try.‚Äù 
‚Äï Jan C. Wendenburg, CEO of certgate GmbH.

For this example we're gonna use `Keycloak` with `Nest.js`.

‚ô™ Pre-requisites:
>Install docker compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install

---
### Build/Run:

 1. Clone the repo and navigate to the root folder.
 2. Run `docker-compose up -d keycloak` in terminal.
 3. Open http://localhost:8080 and click on `Administration Console`.
 4. Login using: username: `admin` and password `admin`.
 5. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/admin/master/console/#/master/add-realm.
 6. Click browse and select the attached [realm-export.json](realm-export.json) file then click `Create`.
 7. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/admin/master/console/#/demo/users/add-user to add a new user and enter `testuser` for the username field then click `Create`.
 8. Now navigate to user `Credentials` tab and click `Set password` then enter the value `demo` for both password and password confirmation, set `Temporary` toggle to **off** and click `save` then `save password`.
 9. Navigate to `Role mapping` tab then click `Assign role` and select `app-user` role then click `Assign`.
 10. From http://localhost:8080/admin/master/console/#/demo/realm-settings set the `Frontend URL` value to `http://keycloak.docker:8080`.
 11. Go to http://localhost:8080/admin/master/console/#/demo/clients and click on `nest-demo` client then navigate to `Credentials` tab, for `Client secret` field click `Regenerate` then confirm and copy the new value.
 12. Open [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) and replace `KC_CLIENT_SECRET` value `<REPLACE_ME>` at line 37 with the  copied client secret value from the previous step then run `docker-compose up nest-demo-service` in terminal.

 ### Test:
 You can test all endpoints using the provided [Postman Collection](nest-demo.postman_collection.json)!
 > *Token revocation and revoking active sessions: https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#_revocation-policy

>**Logout
For browser applications, you can redirect the browser to http://{KEYCLOAK_URL}/auth/realms/{REALM_NAME}/protocol/openid-connect/logout?redirect_uri={ENCODED_REDIRECT_URI}, which logs you out if you have an SSO session with your browser.

#### Suggestions & Improvements:

 - We could achieve a multitenancy web application neatly via integrating our API gateway with any `OAuth2-based` tool like: IdentityServer4, Keycloak, Firebase Auth, AWS Cognito, etc.) and handling the authentication and authorization through the API gateway itself. See: [Kong: API Gateway Authentication](https://konghq.com/learning-center/api-gateway/api-gateway-authentication).
